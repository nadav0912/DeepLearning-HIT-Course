# Deep Learning Course Assignments (B.Sc.)

This repository represents a comprehensive collection of advanced assignments and theoretical proofs completed during the **Deep Learning course** within my **B.Sc. degree**.

The coursework bridges the gap between rigorous mathematical theory and high-performance software engineering. It documents the progressive implementation of complex neural network architectures from scratch, covering everything from the mathematical derivation of backpropagation gradients to the design and training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks using PyTorch.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by specific assignment modules, reflecting a structured progression through deep learning fundamentals. Each directory follows a standardized format containing both the source code (Jupyter Notebook) and a high-fidelity rendered PDF.
